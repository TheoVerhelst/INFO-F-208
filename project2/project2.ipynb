    "## Background and objectives\n",
    "Alignment of amino acids sequences has been explained in the introduction of the first project. In certain circumstances, we can have sequences known to belong to a specific protein domain, and we may want to align them in order to trace the evolution pattern of a specific domain across multiple species.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, a BLOSUM matrix specialised for that domain would be better than a generic one, because the matrix values would be statistically suited to align that domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the point of this project: construct a BLOSUM matrix suited to align a specific domain. We will use the BLOCKS database to get aligned short sequences of that domain. These alignments will be used to compute statistical information about the substitutions occuring in that domain, and subsequently to make the BLOSUM matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code\n",
    "The code of this project is mainly functionnal and imperative. Since the algorithm of creation of BLOSUM matrix is clearly divided into successive steps, object-oriented programming would not be the best choice."
